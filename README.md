# AdventOfCode-2023

Thanks for checking out my solutions for Advent of code 2023.

I tried coding all solotions in C as that was the language I was learning at the time.

# Notes

- This is my first year competing.
- At first I also included the input files, it was later adressed to me (by reddit) that the creator preffered that you didn't post these online.
- When i got to day 4 it took me too long to finish, also alot of school assignments had to be done wich were more important.
